The previous [version 2.0](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/insomnia-rest-client/gmodihnfibbjdecbanmpmbmeffnmloel) 
of Insomnia
was a Chrome application, installed via the Chrome Web Store.
Due to certain limitations of Chrome Apps, Insomnia 3.0 is now a standalone desktop app 
and is supported on Mac, Windows, and Linux.
